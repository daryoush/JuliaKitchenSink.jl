Note:  Does Manifest.yaml need to be in git https://discourse.julialang.org/t/does-manifest-toml-belong-in-the-repository/12029


The Manifest allows someone to replicate the exact version of the dependencies that was recorded in the manifest on e.g. another machine. For a package that is to be used as a library, this is not super useful because there will be some other Manifest dictating the versions of what is installed.
However, for an “application”, i.e. something at “top level” (say your julia code to do the simulations in a scientific paper) then it is likely useful to be able to replicate that exact state and the Manifest is thus useful to check in.
